                    <p>
                        The Parish Pastoral Council is a consultative body – in line with the provisions of the Code of Canon. The Council gives its help to the Priest-in-Charge in fostering pastoral activity. It investigates, under the authority of the Priest-in-Charge, all those things which pertain to pastoral works to ponder them, and to propose practical conclusions about them.</p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, the Parish Pastoral Council's purpose is to enhance the process of:<br>
                        · pastoral planning<br>
                        · developing pastoral programs<br>
                        · improving pastoral services<br>
                        · evaluating the pastoral effectiveness of various programs and services<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Priest-in-Charge presides over the Parish Pastoral Council and is responsible for the final approval of Council recommendations concerning pastoral planning, programs, and services for the parish, as well as for their implementation. </p>
